    aboutMe: `                    One day Vako had enough with the 9-to-5 grind, or more like 9-to-9 in his case, and quit his job, or
                    more like got himself fired from his own startup.
    
                    He decided to work on his dream: be his own boss, travel the world, only do the work he enjoyed, and
                    make a lot more money in the process. No more begging for vacation days and living from paycheck to
                    paycheck. After trying everything from e-commerce stores to professional poker his lucky break came when
                    he started freelance design. Vako fell in love with the field that gives him the lifestyle of his
                    dreams.
    
                    Vako realizes that people who take courses on Udemy want to transform their lives. Today with his
                    courses and mentoring Vako is helping thousands of people transform their lives, just like he did once.`
